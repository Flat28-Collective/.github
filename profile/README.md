<h2 align=center>About</h2>
We are a collective of people from all over the world with a burning passion for video games.
Coming from all entertainment industries and loving each other's crafts we decided to get together to create OUR game, OUR manifestation of existence.
Welcome to <b>FLAT28</b>, the guts of the forgotten society.
